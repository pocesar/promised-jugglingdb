due to https://github.com/1602/jugglingdb/issues/380#issuecomment-47426717 this library is now deprecated. 
jugglingdb is a mess, and will stay this way because the author want it that way. I recomend using https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler that is much better coded, maintained and is properly structured.
